# About

This SPA is a simple shopping cart of a fictional online shop created with React. 

The cart contains three items by default, which can be deleted or their quantites altered with the provided buttons. The value of the cart stays updated according to the products and their quantities.

A filled shopping cart can be submitted with the Buy Now -button, which triggers a POST request. An alert confirms the successful submit of the cart to the user.
